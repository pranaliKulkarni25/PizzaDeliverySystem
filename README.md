# PizzaDeliverySystem

One of the most amazing features of online pizza ordering system is that you can build your pizzas
from the scratch. This system provides the options to create your custom pizzas with everything of
your choice.
Let me tell you more about making custom pizzas.
 The customer will get an option to select pizza’s crust size which can be small, medium, or
large.
 Then the customer has to choose the sauce to be used on his pizza crust. These can marinara,
cheese, ranch, and others.

 Then the system asks the customer whether to add cheese or not. They also have an option to
select for extra cheese.
 At last the system shows the customers different types of toppings.

 One important point to be noticed here is after each step, the updated price of your custom-
built pizza is shown to the customers. Each item’s price is also reflected below its image.

After the customer has finished selecting the items to be ordered, the order is saved, and order id is
generated for the customer.
